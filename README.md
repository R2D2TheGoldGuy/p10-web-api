# Project 10 - Web Api

Main Objective: Choose any api you fancy and create a project where you must grab data from at least 6 items of that API. Display these items on a page in an attractive gallery of images or titles. Clicking the image or title, opens a lightbox just as in the "Interactive Gallery" project earlier with detailed information about the item.
