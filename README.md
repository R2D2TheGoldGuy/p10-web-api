# Project 10 - Web Api

Main Objective: Choose any api you fancy and create a project where you must grab data from at least 6 items of that API. Display these items on a page in an attractive gallery of images or titles. Clicking the image or title, opens a lightbox just as in the "Interactive Gallery" project earlier with detailed information about the item.

Note: These projects are intended to train you in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement the designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
